# AB-Testing-Marketing-Analysis
A/B test evaluation comparing control vs variant to measure statistical significance and business impact on user behavior and conversion.


Goal

Evaluate whether a new marketing change drives a statistically significant improvement in user behavior compared to the control group.

Overview

This project analyzes an A/B experiment designed to measure the impact of a marketing intervention on user engagement and conversion. Using statistical testing and cohort comparison, the goal is to determine if the variant version should be rolled out or if it does not provide enough improvement versus the baseline.

Key Questions

Does the treatment variant perform better than control?

Is the improvement statistically significant?

What is the measurable business impact?

Methodology

Data cleaning and preparation

Hypothesis setup (H0 / H1)

Descriptive analysis of both groups

A/B significance testing (p-value based decision)

Interpretation and business recommendation

Result (summary)

The analysis determines the final decision on whether the variant outperforms the control in a reliable way, preventing expensive marketing decisions based on intuition instead of data.
